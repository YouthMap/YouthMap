# Youth Map

The Youth Map is a website providing a geographical map for coordinating YOTA (Youngsters on the Air), JOTA (Jamboree on the Air) and other Amateur Radio events involving young people.

This project is a work in progress and is still at a very early stage. Please note that while the software currently bears an RSGB logo as a placeholder, it is not yet endorsed by the RSGB or live anywhere on the web except for testing purposes.
